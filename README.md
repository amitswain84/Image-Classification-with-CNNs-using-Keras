# Image-Classification-with-CNNs-using-Keras
Image Classification with CNNs using Keras Machine Learning Project

This project is about how to create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in Keras with a TensorFlow backend, and you will learn to train CNNs to solve Image Classification problems. In this project, we will create and train a CNN model on a subset of the popular CIFAR-10 dataset.The same technique can be used to solve image classification problems on your own data as well.
